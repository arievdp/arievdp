### Hi there 👋

I am drawn to finding solutions by pairing ideas with technical skills and a keen eye for detail. Most recently, my curiosity has led me to build expertise as a full stack developer. In my previous career, it enabled me to travel to over 50 countries as a sound engineer and tour manager in collaboration with international music artists.
